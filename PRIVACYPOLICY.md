# Privacy Policy of Msync
Msync is an open source app to sync your Meetup events into your Android calendar. You can look into it to see what it does at https://github.com/the4thfloor/msync

## What information do we collect?
This app was built to sync your Meetup events into your Android calendar. To do this, you need to log in to your Meetup account. The app transmits your login information directly over a secure connection to Meetup.

During this login, we get some necessary profile information about you from Meetup. We use your full name to identify the calendar entries as your Meetup events. We also get an access token to access the Meetup server on your behalf. We use Androids AccountManager to store this token at a secure place on your Android device.

We never store your Meetup credentials on your device or somewhere else.

We don't have our backend server, so we don't have your data in our own hands.

## How to delete your stored data
To remove your stored data delete this app. We don't have our backend server, so we don't have your data in our own hands. To revoke our permission to access your data at Meetup go to https://www.meetup.com/account/oauth_apps/ and click on "Revoke Access".

## Required Permissions
