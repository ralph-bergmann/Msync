===================

With Msync you can sync your Meetup events into your Android calendar. Not more.
This is the open and free source of the Msync.

If you just want to run the app download it from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.the4thfloor.msync)
If you have wishes, comments or you found a bug please report them [here](https://github.com/the4thfloor/Msync/issues).
